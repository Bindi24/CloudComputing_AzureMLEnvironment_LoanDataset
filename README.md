AutomatedML and Pipeline Machine Learning Models created in Azure Environment (Classification Model)

#Introduction
The loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organisations for obtaining loans from a institution. It includes various factors such as cibil score, income, employment status, loan term, loan amount, assets value, and loan status. The dataset is used in machine learning and data analysis to develop models and algorithms that predict the likelihood of the loan approval based on the features.

Problem Statement:

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. Customer-first applies for a home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for a loan.
The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling the online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others. 

To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify customers, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. 

Hypothesis:

Automating the loan eligibility process using machine learning algorithms based on customer details will significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of identifying eligible loan applicants for Dream Housing Finance Company.

Objective:

This Project creates AutomatedML and Pipeline in Azure Environment and predict whether the loan will be approved for an individual or not on the basis of features such as cibil score, education level, annual income etc.
